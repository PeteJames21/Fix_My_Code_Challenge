# Fix-my-code-0
The original code (before debugging) can be found at https://github.com/alx-tools/0x00-Fix_My_Code_Challenge

## 0-fizzbuzz.py
Modify this file so that `FizzBuzz` is printed for every number that is a multiple of both 3 and 5. e.g. `15` should print `FizzBuzz`, not `Fizz`.

## 1-print_square.js
The Javascript code does not correctly print square sizes >= 10. Modify the file to fix the bug.
