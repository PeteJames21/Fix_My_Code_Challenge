The original code (before debugging) can be found at https://github.com/alx-tools/0x00-Fix_My_Code_Challenge

## 0-fizzbuzz.py
Modify this file so that `FizzBuzz` is printed for every number that is a multiple of both 3 and 5. e.g. `15` should print `FizzBuzz`, not `Fizz`.

## 1-print_square.js
The Javascript code does not correctly print square sizes >= 10. Modify the file to fix the bug.

## 2-sort.rb
The Ruby code is supposed to sort integers in ascending order but fails to do so correctly. Modify the file so that the sorting is done as intended.

## 3-user.py
Fix the python code to make sure the password is encrypted and saved correctly and the password comparison works well.

## 4-delete_dnodeint/
Fix the C implementation of the doubly linked list so that node deletion is done correctly.
